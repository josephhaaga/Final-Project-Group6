## Group 6 Final Project
### Vinay Bhandaru, Joseph Haaga
All codes run independently, although in terms of experimental steps, the first is "Select best optimizer...", then "Fit model", then "Fit model - normalization", and "Fit model -normalization-multiple layers".  The last program has the best model.  The only change needed is to change the path for the initial data read in step.

#### Addendum
threelayertwopaddingdropout.py trains and tests a CNN model capable of achieving 92% accuracy on the test set
